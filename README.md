## Format

The format follows the classical TSPLIB format, with new sections `ACCEPTED_PROBABILITIES` for the probabilities and `OUTSOURCING_COSTS` for the fees.
The size reported in the filename of each instance refers to the total number of vertices, including the depot.
So an instance file starting with `sz-13-` will have thirteen vertices: twelve delivery points and one depot.
The depot is also listed in the probabilities and fees sections mentioned above, as the first entry; it always has probability 0 and fee 0.
Furthermore, the coordinates of the depot are always (0, 0).
